# U-VR

U-VR is a Rust-based engine for building persistent online worlds and VR-capable experiences.

## Goals
- Custom renderer (wgpu)
- Authoritative server
- Deterministic world simulation
- No legacy engine constraints
- Designed for VR, but not limited to it

## Status
Early engine bring-up.
Renderer, client, and server skeleton are live.

## Philosophy
Own the stack.
Build forward.
No nostalgia.
